##Turing Vactrol Mix Expander   

- A 4 in, 2 out  vactrol matrix mixer controlled by the Turing Machine  
- Creates rhythmic patterns (or evolving drones) from any audio sources 
- Great for feedback loops  
- DC coupled, so you can also rhythmically cut up DC sources; LFOs etc.  

Circuit inspired by Grant Richter's Cadavre Exquis voltage controlled mixer.
